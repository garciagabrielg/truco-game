# Welcome to the game of Truco

## The game is based upon the popular game of cards in Brazil called "Truco".

#### Under construction

The idea is to implement using Java as the backend and the frontend as a webApp.

The rules are simple:
-You and the opponent get 3 cards;
-1 Card is the "Turn" or "vira";
-If you have the face value of the card as the next value of the vira (vira +1) you have a "Manilha";
-If both players have "Manilhas", then we analize the shape in the order of strongest to weakest being:
  -Clubs,Hearts,Spades and Diamonds;
-Else, the order of the cards are, from strongest to weakest: 3,2,A,K,J,Q,7,6,5,4.
-If one of the parties reach 2 points, then you get a round point;
-Game finishes at 15 points;
